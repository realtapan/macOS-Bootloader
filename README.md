# What happens in the macOS boot process
  * Power is turned on.
  * EFI code is executed.
  * Hardware information is collected and hardware is initialized.
  * The OS boot up.

To boot macOS on **Apple** hardware an **EFI** (Firmware) file is needed, without it macOS is non-bootable. During last decades many developer's came with an idea to boot macOS on **Non-Apple** hardware, and they succeded. Some of them are **CLOVER** & **OPENCORE**. This are a piece of software which build an **EFI** based on your hardware so that one can boot macOS on any **Intel** based harware **(non-Apple)**. We'll use **OPENCORE** as it has been designed with security and quality in mind, allowing us to use many security features found on real Macs, such as System Integrity Protection and FileVault.

We provide a pre-made **EFI** based on **Non-Apple** hardware. So one can simply download the copy of their **EFI** move to their bootable device and install macOS on their hardware.

- **EFI** is only available after fully tested along with hardware configuration's.
- Currently limited numbers of **EFI** are available for both Desktop & Laptop, due to unavailable of every hardware.
